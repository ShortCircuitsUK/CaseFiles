The Rack is a Eurorack style case that displays boards on top and holds other boards underneath. 
You can hide non-display boards like the Motherboard and the Sensor Array underneath, 
with the display boards like the Digitiser and RGB Matrix on the top.

The standard design holds 4 boards but it can be modified to hold 2 boards using half length 
horizontal beams. 

Print:

Print 2 side panels. Flip one on the print bed to have the same finish on the outsides of each panel. 
Print 2 rails. 
Print or buy 4 2x3x7mm (HxIDxOD) spacers per board (these give clearance for the wires to tuck under the boards). 

Hardware:

4 x 6mm M3 screws (comes with each kit)
4 x 6mm+ M5 screws

Assembly:

Screw 2 boards to one side of the rails using the M3 screws and spacers. Start with a Motherboard. 
The Motherboard needs to be on the left if you are looking from underneath to make sure
the Motherboard's USB port is alligned to the gap in the side panel. 
Add wires to the Motherboard giving yourself plenty of slack to connect to the other boards. 
Feed the wires under the Motherboard and wire the second board to the motherboard. 
Do the same with the other 2 boards and screw them down with the wires tucked out of sight. 
Screw the side panels on and that's it.
