The Rack is a Eurorack style case that displays boards on top and holds other boards underneath. 
You can hide non-display boards like the Motherboard and the Sensor Array underneath, 
with the display boards like the Digitiser and RGB Matrix on the top.

The standard design holds 4 boards but it can be modified to hold 2 boards using half length 
horizontal beams.
